# 💘 Valentine — Interactive Web Experience

An immersive, animated "Will You Be My Valentine?" web experience designed with cinematic transitions, smooth UI interactions, and responsive layout.

Built as a playful yet polished front-end project demonstrating animation timing, DOM manipulation, and user experience design.

## 🎯 Overview

This project is a lightweight interactive landing page where:

- Users are presented with a Valentine proposal
- The "No" button triggers progressive state changes
- The "Yes" button activates a smooth cinematic transition
- Background video updates dynamically without visual flicker
- All animations use controlled opacity transitions for a premium feel

The focus was on:
- Seamless UI transitions
- Zero white flash on background change
- Mobile-first responsiveness
- Clean structure without external libraries

## ⚙️ How It Works

The application uses a simple state machine pattern:

- A step counter tracks interaction progress
- Conditional logic updates content dynamically
- Opacity transitions ensure smooth DOM updates
- Background video changes use fade-out → source swap → fade-in

No page reloads.
No route changes.
Pure DOM manipulation.
